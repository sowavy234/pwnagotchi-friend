Overview and Goals  
Overview and Goals

	•	Advanced Interaction: Enable the companion to communicate with the Pwnagotchi and display interaction logs on the host screen.
	•	Auto-Configuration: Automate the setup and optimization of display settings for both the host (Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH with display hat mini) and the companion (Raspberry Pi Zero W-2 with a 2.13-inch E-Ink display).
	•	AI Enhancement: Update and enhance the AI running on the Pwnagotchi to function smarter and support adaptive behavior.
	•	File Creation and Replacement: Create and replace necessary files programmatically, ensuring seamless updates.
	•	Internet Connectivity: Ensure the system can fetch and use online resources for real-time updates and data analysis.

Development Strategy

	1.	Modular Architecture: Design a modular codebase with distinct components for:
	•	Interaction Module: Facilitates communication between the Pwnagotchi and its companion.
	•	Auto-Configuration Module: Handles display and system configuration.
	•	AI Upgrade Module: Updates and enhances the AI algorithms.
	•	File Management Module: Manages the creation and replacement of system files.
	2.	Python and External Libraries:
	•	Use Python libraries like RPi.GPIO, spidev, or Pillow for hardware interaction.
	•	Use subprocess for executing system commands and requests for fetching online data.
	3.	Voice Interaction:
	•	Integrate espeak or pyttsx3 for text-to-speech capabilities.
	•	Implement an input system using speech_recognition for voice commands if required.
	4.	UI and Display Management:
	•	Use Pillow and inky for E-Ink display rendering.
	•	Ensure compatibility with display hat mini using libraries specific to the display model.
	5.	Internet Access and Updates:
	•	Implement requests or http.client to fetch data from the Internet.
	•	Use git and subprocess to pull updates from online repositories.
